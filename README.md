Hey guys! This is my second game project and it's called "The Frantic Run." It's a simple game where a monster chases after a rabbit and you have to jump over the hedgehogs and try to collect carrots by jumping over, which will add to the score that will increase the longer you (the rabbit) are alive. I got inspired by the dinosaur game when you don't have any internet and subway surfers. However, I wanted to try something new and make it unique from these types of other games that are already like Subway Surfers and Temple Run. So that's why I made my game 3D but the rabbit goes around a planet-like sphere.
